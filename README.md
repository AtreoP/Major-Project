# Smart Drone System Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques

This project implements a smart drone system with capabilities for real-time object detection and noise detection, using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. The system integrates with a web-based interface that allows users to view real-time object detection results and control the drone’s movements and parameters.

## Introduction
In recent years, drones have become invaluable across various industries, such as agriculture, surveillance, logistics, and disaster management. By integrating ML and DL, particularly YOLO for object detection and RNNs for noise analysis, this project enhances drone autonomy, enabling it to accurately identify and track objects and respond to specific acoustic signals in real-time.

## Project Architecture
The project consists of two main components:
- **Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) for real-time detection, leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for high accuracy and speed.
- **Noise Detection**: Employs a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM layers to identify and distinguish between environmental sounds, which aids in navigation and safety in noisy environments.

### Workflow
1. **Object Detection and Tracking**: YOLOv8 performs detection on drone video feeds, with CNNs classifying detected objects and RNNs tracking object movement across frames.
2. **Control and Command**: A web interface allows users to control the drone’s movement and detection parameters.
3. **Real-Time Monitoring**: A secure web interface displays the drone’s live feed and detection results, enabling real-time interaction.

## Features
- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Uses YOLOv8 to detect and classify objects in real time.
- **Noise Detection**: RNN-LSTM-based system for recognizing significant sounds in the environment.
- **Web-Based Control**: Interactive UI for remote drone control and viewing detection results.
- **API Integration**: RESTful API to manage interactions between the web interface and drone.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Flask, TensorFlow (for model loading and detection)
- **Frontend**: React (for UI and control interface)
- **Database**: MongoDB (to store user data and session information)
- **Machine Learning**: YOLOv8 for object detection, RNN with LSTM for noise detection

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB (for data storage)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-drone-system.git
   cd smart-drone-system
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**
   - Install Python dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install flask flask-cors tensorflow pillow numpy
     ```
   - Download the pre-trained YOLOv8 model (or SSD MobileNet) and place it in the `models/ssd_mobilenet_v2` directory.
   - Run the Flask server:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

3. **Frontend Setup**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd object-detection-frontend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the React app:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

4. **Database Setup**
   - Ensure MongoDB is running locally or set up a cloud instance, and configure your connection string.

## Usage
1. Open the React app on `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Upload an image to perform object detection or access the live video feed for real-time detection.
3. Use the control panel to adjust drone movement and detection parameters.

## Future Directions
1. **Reinforcement Learning** for enhanced autonomous navigation.
2. **Edge AI** for on-drone processing, reducing latency and improving performance.
3. **Noise-Canceling Enhancements** to handle more complex environments.
4. **Swarm Drones** for collaborative tasks in larger areas.
